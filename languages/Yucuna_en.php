Kanumá was left on his own. He then met the two daughters of Je'chú (the Sky), one of whom became his wife, bringing him tubers (cassava, yams), garden fruits (chontaduro, pineapples, etc.), and even coca. </p>

      <h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to the Yucuna language and writing system</h3>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;Yucuna&quot; Indians refers to the group of Native Americans who habitually speak Yucuna with their families. The Yucuna language belongs to the Arawak family (Schauer, 1975). The Yucuna Indians share many cultural traits with the Tanimuca and the Letuama, their main exogamic partners, as well as similar practices (kinship organization, maloca, shamanism). Their culture differs however from that of the other neighboring tribes (Miraña, Huitoto, Tucano) covering a vast geographical zone, including Miriti-Parana, Popeyaca, and Guacaya (Jacopin, 1970, 1977, 1981). </P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the Yucuna Indians mainly live on the banks of the Miriti-Parana river and in the area of La Pedrera on the Lower Caqueta in Colombia (see map). Estimates set their population at between 500 and 1000 people. </P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Yucuna language was first documented in 1963 by an American linguist couple from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). They published a phonology (Schauer et Schauer, 1967), a translation of the Caripú Laquena myth (1975) and a grammar (1978). In the 1980s and 1990s they also prepared materials and trained assistants in Yucuna for literacy programs in bilingual schools (Matapi, 1984; Yucuna, 1994). More recently, they have translated the Old and New Testaments into Yucuna and have published a new phonological and syntactic study of the language (Schauer and Schauer, 2000)..</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the writing system, they chose to base the Yucuna alphabet on that of Spanish in order to facilitate its teaching and use among the Yucuna and avoid spelling confusion between Spanish and Yucuna. </P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This notation system however has led to much debate among linguists and Yucuna speakers, and no final writing system has yet been adopted. . </P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Judging by the most recent work I have been able to consult but which has yet to be published, some standards have been agreed upon, despite the fact that they still need to be defined explicitly, and are not used by all of the language's writers. To transcribe our data, we have used the main standards which are currently most in use, and have made a certain number of choices which will be explained below.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The greatest remaining ambiguity probably resides in the rules for noting stress. As far as we know, no definitive consensus has been reached on the subject. The SIL linguists have chosen to apply the same rules as for Spanish, while other linguists and local teachers note stress on the accented vowel, independently of its morphological status. Given the confusion, most native speakers do not note stress (or at least not systematically), which leads to much confusion between morphemes – this is also the case in Tanimuca. To avoid such confusion here, we have chosen to follow the SIL linguists' system. This system works as follows: </P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As all morphemes in Yucuna end in a vowel, stress is noted to show accentuation, except when it falls on the penultimate syllable. </P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1. The first exception concerns their notation of /w/ (noted hu) and /k/ (noted c before a, o and u, and qu before e and i), which are now respectively noted w and k.</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remark: this new notation is made more problematic because of borrowings from Spanish. If one changes the spelling of these borrowings, this could lead to confusion for those who wish to write in Spanish, but if the original spelling is retained in Yucuna texts, this could also lead to quite some confusion… The best solution is probably to leave the question open, so that native writers may make their own choice. </P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2. The other major modification which has been applied to the initial SIL notation system concerns <em>vowels in a glottal context</em>. </P>

Thus the distinction between 'CVʔ VCV and 'CVʔ CV is not relevant in Yucuna.</P>
