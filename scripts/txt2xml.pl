# txt2xml.pl 
# Inserts markup in plain-text glossed documents.
# Created in 2011 by Alexis Michaud.
# This is version 5 of the script, May 2013.
# Based on Boyd Michailovsky's chk_spc6_new.
# COMMANDLINE: perl -w txt2xml.pl < infile
# Messages appear on screen (can be redirected by command line >); xml output in a file "xmlout.xml".
# program treats groups of lines in fixed order. 
# sentence in IPA
# words separated by spaces and/or tabs
# French glosses
# notes: any paragraph starting with a percent sign % is a note
# French translation of sentences
# OPTIONALLY: translations into another language such as Chinese. The option must be set within the script below.
